# Building my own database in Golang

I want to learn more about Golang as a Language and also learn more about how databases work, so why not build a DB on Go?

Will base myself on this [book](https://build-your-own.org/database/).

Aiming to build a (mostly) functional DB so I can understand all the moving parts of an actual functionable and professional DB.
